##### *Why make graphs in R?*

* Easy to manipulate graphs
* Can create many types of plots
* Able to show statistical results on graphs
* Make graphs that are visually appealing


#### The basics of plotting in R

In R, the basic plotting function is *plot()* 

This function can be used to visualize data from a data frame that has been saved in your global environment.

Let's try making a basic plot using an existing dataset in R, **iris**

```{r}
head(iris)

# Plotting Sepal.Length vs. Petal.Length in the iris dataset.

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length)

# This shows us information, but let's clean it up to make it easier to interpret

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, pch=16, col="blue", xlab="Sepal Length (cm)", ylab="Petal Length(cm)")

# What does pch do? Try changing the number to 15 or 17.
# Test out different colors using the col() command
# xlab and ylab let you rename the axes 

# Now, let's add a trendline to see the linear relationship here using abline which adds a line over your previous plot:

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, pch=16, col="blue", xlab="Sepal Length (cm)", ylab="Petal Length(cm)")
abline(lm(iris$Petal.Length ~ iris$Sepal.Length),col="blue")

# Want to add a title to your graph? Call your plot again and then use the title() command to add a title
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length, pch=16, col="blue", xlab="Sepal Length (cm)", ylab="Petal Length(cm)")
abline(lm(iris$Petal.Length ~ iris$Sepal.Length),col="blue")
title("Comparison between sepal and petal lengths in Irises")

```

```{r}
# Try making your own graph of sepal verses petal width with a trendline


```



Now that we've covered the basic plots, let's go over different components a plot.

1. Parameters of plots

  * There are many, many options for plotting in R. You can set up the **parameters** of your plot to fit multiple graphs within   your plotting region, change the margins of the plotting region, and adjust the appearance of the text on your plots
  * To change the parameters of your plot, use the command *par()*
  * You will most likely use mfrow, mar, oma, and bty as common parameter commands
  * mfrow is really important if you are trying to plot multiple graphs in the same region; *par(mfrow=c(1,2))* for example         means that you want 1 row and 2 columns of graphs in the plotting region.
```{r}
# Look at the help file of par() to see all of the options available for changing the parameter of your graph
?par()
```

2. Types of graphs

* Histograms *hist()*
```{r}
hist(iris$Sepal.Length, xlab="Sepal Length (cm)")
```

* Line or scatter *plot()*
      * To get a scatter plot, simply plot data
      * To get a line graph, plot data and specfy type="l" within plot command
```{r}
osprey<-read.csv("OspreyNationData.csv")
head(osprey)

# A graph with points
plot(osprey$Year, osprey$MappedNests, # Tells us which data we are plotting (year on x axis, mapped nests on y)
     ylim = c(0, 700), # Tells us the limit of the y axis - so axis is going from 0 to 700
     ylab = "Number of mapped nests", # The name of the y axis 
     xlab = "Year", # The name of the x axis
     pch = 16, # The shaped of the point
     col = c("dark blue"), # The color of the point
     las = 1, # The direction the text on the x-axis
     cex = 1.0) # The size of the point

# The same graph with a line connecting the points
plot(osprey$Year, osprey$MappedNests, 
     type = "l", # Use a line type to show data
     ylim = c(0, 700), 
     ylab = "Number",
     xlab = "Year",
     pch = 16,
     col = c("dark blue"),
     las = 1,
     lwd = 3, # Line width is 3 so it looks bold
     cex = 2)

# Another option:
plot(osprey$Year, osprey$MappedNests, 
     type = "b", # Use a line type with points to show data
     ylim = c(0, 700), 
     ylab = "Number",
     xlab = "Year",
     pch = 16,
     col = c("dark blue"),
     las = 1,
     lwd = 3, 
     cex = 2)

```

* Barplot *barplot()*
```{r}
barplot(osprey$Stewards, 
        ylim=c(0,250), 
        xlab="Year",
        ylab="Number of Stewards",
        names.arg=c(2014,2015,2016))

```

* Pie chart (general rule: don't use pie charts)
```{r}
piepieces<-c(3,5,6)
pie(piepieces)

```
* Boxplots
```{r}
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species,
        xlab="Iris species",
        ylab="Sepal Length (cm)")
# Try adding a title to your boxplot here!
# Can you make each box a different color for each species and add a legend to say which color goes with which species?

# Using par(c(mfrow=1,2)), plot a boxplot next to the one you just made above with Sepal Width instead of length

```


3. Plotting options

* The plot function has tons of options to change color, labels, tick marks on the axes, shapes of points, line widths, etc.
* To review more plotting options, look at the help file 
```{r}
?plot()
```
* Sometimes, you need to fix the axes on your plot. To do this, set xaxt="n" or yaxt="n" then use an additional line of code to 
  add a new axis and new tick marks
```{r}
plot(osprey$Year, osprey$MappedNests, 
     type = "b", 
     ylim = c(0, 700), 
     xaxt = "n",
     ylab = "Number",
     xlab = "Year")
axis(side = 1, labels = 2014:2016, at = 2014:2016)
```
* Need to add a legend to your graph after adding multiple series of data? Use the *legend()* command on a new line after calling a plot and adding *lines()*
```{r}

plot(osprey$Year, osprey$MappedNests, type = "b", ylim = c(0, 700), xaxt = "n",ylab = "Number", xlab = "Year",  pch = 15,  col = c("brown"),   las = 1,   lwd = 3,   cex = 2)
axis(side = 1, labels = 2014:2016, at = 2014:2016)
lines(osprey$Year,osprey$ActiveNests, type = "b",  pch= 18,   col = "skyblue",  lwd=3,  cex=2)
legend("bottomright", # location of legend in graph
       legend = c("Mapped nests", "Known active nests"), # arguments in legened
       pch = c(15,18), # symbols representing each series
       col = c("brown","skyblue"), # color representing series
       bty = "n") # remove box around legend
```


4. Saving plots

  It's important to export and save your graphs on to your computer so you can insert them in papers, manuscripts, etc.

  There are a few options for saving graphs, but they all follow the same principles:

* Open the device that you'll use to save your image (*png()*, *pdf()*, or *bmp()*)
      * This will save it in your current working directory
      * Put the desired name of the graph inside the parentheses in quotations 
      * Make sure to end the name with the type of device i.e. png("mygraph.png")
      * Can specify height= and width= to get dimensions of the image
* Plot your graph
* Use the *dev.off()*to stop plotting and tell R to save the plot to your computer
```{r}
png("mypie.png", width = 300, height = 400)
pie(piepieces)
dev.off()

# After running this, check in your current working directory folder and you should have a new image call "mypie"
```

# GGPLOT!

### Now that you've master the basic plotting functions, let's move on to ggplot

> ggplot is a package used to create graphs

Some people prefer ggplot to normal plotting functions because it is easier to use and can do more with visualization

Unfortunately, it uses an entirely different syntax than what we just learned! 

But, you may find it easier to use because to plot a graph, each part of the graph is added to a chain of code as if each part were a new layer for the plot. 

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")

library(ggplot2)
```

The basics of ggplot for making a simple scatter plot or line graph:


* In the ggplot() command, you enter your data frame and aesthetics, or aes()
        * Within aes, you want to specify your x and y values by doing x= and y=
        * This will be your first layer
```{r}

library(MASS)
head(women)
ggplot(data=women, aes(x=height, y=weight))
```
* Running the above code sets up the coordinate system of the graph but doesn't show you any data
* To show your data, you need to add it as a layer using geom_point() or geom_line()
```{r}
ggplot(data=women, aes(x=height, y=weight)) + geom_point()
ggplot(data=women, aes(x=height, y=weight)) + geom_line() 

## You can also add title as a layer and change the axis titles by adding the labs command
ggplot(data=women, aes(x=height, y=weight))  + geom_line() +
  labs(title="Average Height and Weight of American Females", x="Average Height (inches)",y="Average Weight (lbs)") +
  theme_classic() + # Removes grid from the graph
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # Centers the title of the graph
```

To make a bar graph using ggplot, you add a layer called geom_bar 
You can change the appearance of the barplot by changing the position
```{r}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill=cut)) + geom_bar()

ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill=cut)) + geom_bar(position="dodge")
# What does dodge do?

ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill=cut)) + geom_bar(position="fill")
# What does fill do?

```
